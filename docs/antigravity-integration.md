# Antigravity integration

This page owns Antigravity's external contracts: credentials, OAuth, APIs and processes, with their
verified versions. Unchecked platform equivalents are marked *not verified*. AgyOrbit's adapter
implementation lives in [architecture.md](architecture.md#antigravity-adapters); the verification
procedure is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#verifying-against-a-real-antigravity).

| Fact | Verified on | Owner module |
|---|---|---|
| Signed-in credential storage | 2.19.1, macOS 27 | `antigravity/live.rs` |
| Credential bundle format | 2.19.1, macOS 27 | `antigravity/credential.rs` |
| OAuth client and scopes | 2.19.1, macOS 27 | `antigravity/oauth_client.rs`, `google/oauth.rs` |
| Quota and plan endpoints | 2.19.1, macOS 27 | `google/cloudcode.rs` |
| Processes that hold the credential | 2.19.1, macOS 27 | `antigravity/process.rs` |
| Windows equivalents | **not verified** | same modules |

## Signed-in credential

Antigravity's Go language server stores the credential with
[go-keyring](https://github.com/zalando/go-keyring) under service `gemini`, account `antigravity`:

- **macOS**: a generic password in the login keychain, written through `/usr/bin/security`. The value is
  `go-keyring-base64:` followed by base64 of the JSON bundle.
- **Windows** (from go-keyring's documented layout, not yet verified): a generic credential with target
  `gemini:antigravity` whose blob is the raw JSON.

It also mirrors the JSON to `~/.gemini/jetski-standalone-oauth-token` (mode `0600`) and reads that file
when the keyring times out (the binary logs `Keyring LoadStoredToken timed out … falling back to file
storage`). AgyOrbit's read/write strategy is in
[Credential access](architecture.md#credential-access).

## Credential bundle

```json
{
  "token": {
    "access_token": "…",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "refresh_token": "…",
    "expiry": "2026-10-03T17:52:30.076579+08:00"
  },
  "auth_method": "consumer",
  "id_token": "…"
}
```

- `token` is golang.org/x/oauth2's `Token`; `expiry` uses Go's RFC 3339 format with the local offset.
- `auth_method` is `consumer` for personal Google accounts. Workspace / Cloud sign-ins are untested.
- `id_token` identifies the account (`sub`, `email`). A refresh-token grant returns a new one.

Bundle handling during a switch is described in [Credential access](architecture.md#credential-access).

## OAuth client

The consumer sign-in client is `1071006060591-tmhssin2h21lcre235vtolojh4g403ep.apps.googleusercontent.com`
(the `aud` of Antigravity's ID tokens). The binary also embeds a second client used for Google Cloud
sign-in (`884354919052-…`), which AgyOrbit does not use.

The client ID is public. The installed-app secret is embedded in the local binaries and is **not**
stored in this repository. A token request with a bogus authorization code fails with `invalid_grant`
for the matching secret; a wrong secret fails with `invalid_client`. AgyOrbit's scan and selection are
described in [OAuth client discovery](architecture.md#oauth-client-discovery).

Facts the browser sign-in depends on:

- The client is a desktop client: Google accepts `http://127.0.0.1:<any port>/…` redirects.
- Requested scopes are exactly what the IDE's own sign-in is granted (read back via Google's tokeninfo):
  `openid email profile` plus `cloud-platform`, `aicode`, `cclog` and `experimentsandconfigs` under
  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/`. A token from AgyOrbit is therefore interchangeable with the IDE's.
- `prompt=select_account consent` always shows the account chooser and always returns a refresh token.

## Quota and plan

Base URL: `https://daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal` (what Antigravity passes to its language
server as `--cloud_code_endpoint`). Both calls are `POST` with a bearer token.

- **The `User-Agent` must contain `antigravity`.** Without it the API answers 403 "You do not have a valid
  license of this product". AgyOrbit sends `AgyOrbit/<version> (antigravity)`.
- `:retrieveUserQuotaSummary` with `{}` returns `groups[]`, each with `displayName`, a `description` that
  lists the models (`Models within this group: Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, GPT-OSS`) and `buckets[]` with
  `window` (`5h` or `weekly`), `remainingFraction` and `resetTime`. Observed groups: `Gemini Models` and
  `Claude and GPT models`. The response is proto3 JSON, so a fraction of `0` is **omitted**: a bucket
  without `remainingFraction` is exhausted.
- `:loadCodeAssist` with `{"metadata":{"ideType":"ANTIGRAVITY"}}` returns `paidTier` (`g1-pro-tier` /
  "Google AI Pro", Ultra contains `ultra`) and `currentTier` (`free-tier` without a subscription).

## Processes

Every process that may hold the credential has to exit before a switch, or it could write the previous
account back when it refreshes its token:

- the app: `Antigravity.app/Contents/MacOS/Antigravity` (Windows: `Antigravity.exe`);
- its Electron helpers and the language server(s) under the same install root
  (`Contents/Resources/bin/language_server --standalone …`);
- the `agy` CLI.

AgyOrbit's stop and launch mechanism is in [Process control](architecture.md#process-control).
Each new language server creates an empty file in `~/.gemini/antigravity/crashes/`; that is a marker,
not a crash.

## Not touched

`~/Library/Application Support/Antigravity/app_storage.json` keeps
`jetski.onboarding.lastLoginUsername`, which only pre-fills Antigravity's own sign-in screen. AgyOrbit
leaves it alone.
